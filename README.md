# MathBot

# Goal

The goal of this project is to create a Mathbot that can call on a remote server, perform a set of mathematical operations to solve a large number of complex math problems on the input and return the output (solutions) back to the remote server.

# Methodology

In this project, I created a software system that can call a remote server, retrieve information, interpret that information, and solve complex mathematical problems using certain algorithms before returning that solution to the same remote server, doing it all in real time. Hence, in this project, my goal was to create a “Math Robot” that can automatically solve a large number of complex mathematical problems quickly and efficiently (memory usage and speed) and at the same time communicate with a remote server using several Network Programming structures and principles, understand the inputs from that server and return the solutions to those mathematical problems back to the remote server.
